  <p>The essence of continued operational excellence at VCM is the ability to deliver a complete end-to-end service. VCM integrates innovative solutions and best practices in a way that creates a real bond with our clients and ensures high value outcomes for their events - both now and in the future. <em>At VCM, we believe that effective communication breeds efficiency.</em><br />
    <br />
    Efficiency has woven its way into our business practices as well. Nothing can facilitate the event planning process more than eliminating steps, which we&#39;ve done by assuming many 3rd party service provider responsibilities in-house.<br />
    <br />
    VCM&#39;s independently produced events have also grown more efficient - they target the exact audience they should with the precise message that needs to be heard. We know this because the audience has a seat at the planning table, and always will. Our delegates have a stake in their learning, and it&#39;s efficient.<br />
    <br />
    Finally, we&#39;ve streamlined the event planning process so much, that we were able to put the tools we developed in a box, put a bow on it and present EventSystemPro (ESP) to the masses. Designed by VCM&#39;s event planners, ESP&#39;s Suite simplifies the event management process so planners can manage the complexities of multiple events in less time.<br />
    <br />
    <em>As we continue to grow and change, finding efficiencies for ourselves and our clients remains our first priority.</em></p>
